PREPARATION FOR AMBUR BIRIYANI:-

1. Wash and soak rice for 10 mins. This is optional. Drain and set aside.
2. Deseed & soak red chilies for about an hour. Make a fine paste with little water used for soaking. 
3. Heat oil in a pan and saute cinnamon, cloves and cardamoms 
4. Add 2 tbsps onions and saute for 1 to 2 mins. 
5. Saute garlic paste for a minute and then ginger paste as well for a minute. 
6. Add coriander leaves and mint. Saute until it begins to smell good. This may take about 2 mins. 
7. Add the red chilli paste and saute everything together until oil begins to separate. 
8. Add half cup onions and fry for 2 to 3 mins until they turn transparent. 
9. Add tomatoes and fry until they turn very soft and mushy. 
10. Add chicken and fry on a low to medium heat until the chicken turns pale or white. This may take about 2 to 3 mins.
11. Add curd and salt. 
12. Cover the pot and cook for 5 mins on a very low heat. Chicken begins to ooze out moisture. 
13. Mix it and continue to cook until chicken turns completely soft.

COOKING BIRIYANI RICE:-
1. While the chicken cooks, bring water to a boil in a large pot with salt. 
2. Add drained rice and cook until 70% done. At this stage rice is still under cooked and you will very well know that it is undone if you bite it. The grain will still be hard in the center. 
3. Make sure chicken is soft cooked before adding rice. Add coriander and mint leaves. Mix and level the mixture. At this stage you will see lot of moisture that has been released while cooking chicken. 
4. Drain the rice completely and add it to the chicken pot. 
5. Gently stir for the rice to get mixed with the moisture from chicken.

COOKING AMBUR BIRIYANI:-
1. Cover and cook on the lowest heat until the rice has absorbed all the moisture. You can also use a old dosa tawa/ griddle for dum process. To do that heat a griddle first, then place this biryani pot over it. Cook until rice is done. 
2. Open the lid and mix gently again. 
3. If the rice is under cooked and there is no moisture you may sprinkle some warm water. Stir and cook covered. However I did not use any water at this stage.
4. Once the rice is done, fluff up well and cover it again. Cook for another 2 mins. Switch off and rest for about 5 to 20 mins before serving. Fluff up with a fork before serving. 
5. Serve Ambur biryani with ennai kathirikai and raita.
